# Who Then Stole the Beauty of the Game



Snoopy, Calvin, Hobbes, and Susie were gearing up for their big hockey match. As they laced their skates and adjusted their helmets, the tension in the locker room was palpable. 
Calvin looked at Snoopy and asked, "What if the referee makes bad calls?" 
Snoopy shrugged, "Well, if that happens, we'll still play by the rules and make the best of it.' 
Then Hobbes chimed in, "What if they send us to the penalty box unfairly?" 
Susie replied, "We'll sit it out gracefully, then rejoin the game with renewed energy." 
Finally, the game started. As Calvin had feared, the referee seemed to have it out for their team. Calvin and Snoopy received penalties for actions that usually would have gone unnoticed. They spent a significant amount of time in the 
penalty box, frustrated and angry. 
When the final buzzer rang, they had lost the game. The team returned to the locker room, a mix of frustration and exhaustion in the air. 


The coach walked in and asked, "So, how did everyone feel about the game?" 
Calvin vented, "The referee was against us! I spent more time in the penalty box than on the ice!" 
Snoopy added, "Yeah, the game felt unfair!" 
Hobbes and Susie exchanged glances and then Susie spoke up, "I get it, the referee's calls were frustrating, but did you notice the moments when our teamwork shone? Or when we managed a perfect pass, even if it didn't result in a goal?" 
Hobbes added, "The game isn't just about winning or losing, or even fair calls. It's about appreciating the experience, the ice beneath your skates, the thrill of the chase, the elegance of a well-executed play." 
Calvin and Snoopy looked at each other, then back at Hobbes and Susie. It was as if a cloud had lifted. 


The coach nodded, "You may think the referee stole the game from you with bad calls, but who then stole the beauty and joy of playing hockey?" 
Calvin and Snoopy grinned, "Guess we did that to ourselves." 
"Exactly," said Hobbes. "Now let's get ready for the next game, and this time, let's not let anything steal the joy of playing, not even a biased referee." 
And with that, they all left the locker room, each carrying their gear and a newfound appreciation for the beauty of the game.
