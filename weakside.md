# The Weak Side Story
_(not the “West Side Story”)_

Once upon a time there was a frozen pond. And there were people who played games on the pond.

The pond had two sides: A strong side and a weak side. And there were players on each of those two sides of the pond.

Best of all, the pond had a puck – a little black round shaped piece of rubber that came out of only the gods know where. And though you’d think a puck wouldn’t have much intention, that little puck wanted more than anything to be sunk deep into the fishnet strung at either end of the pond.

Now, there were strong players on the strong side of the pond, pushing and shoving and bashing each other with long sticks over possession of the puck. They called it puck possession, which wasn’t really true because they never actually possessed the object. They were too busy pounding on each other. And the puck remained unpossessed, and often kicked aside by mistake in the scuffle.

Those strong players didn’t care much about the puck or what it wanted. They weren’t really playing the game the puck was created to play. They were obsessed with which team won the pushing and shoving match.

The little puck really wanted to play the game, and be part of someone scoring goals. But the strong dudes were too busy with their struggles and wrestling match up to actually play the game or score any goals into the nets.

On the weak side of the pond ice remained pretty much deserted.

Until one day two smart and slightly bored lads accidentally moved the puck to the weak side and discovered open ice. They also discovered that they had so much time and space that they were able to play the game, make interesting moves, and sink the puck into the net – and their game became really fun. They scored some goals one way and scored some more. And the game became fast and beautiful, and gathered a crowd to watch. With every dance of celebration, the spectators rejoiced and roared.

This independent fun didn’t last long, however. The dudes on the strong side noticed that the puck was stolen and clumsily rushed to the weak side to repossess it and continue their pushing and shoving over the puck there.

And this is how the weak side became a strong side, and the former strong side became weak and deserted once again.

But the sneaky players had already discovered the joy of time, space and open ice, not to mention the thrill of moving the puck into the net and dancing about. They discovered that they could move the puck much faster between each other than the strong dudes could move themselves close and start wrestling again. They called that puck movement “the pass”.

And so they passed and moved the puck around strong dudes on to the weak side, and to the open space on the ice, and once again had plenty of time to play the game and score goals.

And so the smartest players played hooky from the strong to the weak side over and over and over again.

And in commemoration of this event, our elders named the game “hockey.” They elected a committee and a commissioner who made rules, and they put referees on the pond to enforce the rules. Someone got creative and pretty and drew some blue and red lines and the trapezoid where no goalie shall scuffle out of. They built the boards and they ruled off-sides, icings, roughing, and even the made a rule about boarding when the strong side players got into their wrestling matches with too much force from behind.

And the players continued to play their increasingly complicated game forever after. And yes, the pushing and shoving on the strong side continued, and nobody paid much attention to the feelings of the poor ignored puck.

But in honor of the original inventors, they still don’t call the banks of the pond left or right, east or west, port or starboard – they still call them the weak side and strong side, and keep switching the names depending on where the sneaky lads move the round-shaped bit of rubber.

Every season they award the sneakiest weak-side team with a silver cup for their time and space creativity.

And you kids who are learning to play the hooky game – when you can remember, correctly identify, and use the weak side of the pond – you may get the cup one day, too.

And if not – there is always pushing and shoving. I know, that’s fun sometimes, too.
