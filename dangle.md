# Dangle dangle little star

Once upon a time there was a pond in winter. And on that pond were skaters, and there was a glorious game. And some grew up playing the game while others moved to the pond and joined later. But everyone agreed it was the best game ever, and gathered to watch it being played.

The most skilled of the players dangled the puck through the rows of less skilled players, leaving them behind. The less skilled sometimes lost their balance, their bearings, or fell all over the ice, leaving the most skilled players free to score innumerable goals.

No one questioned the way of the game - least of all the most skilled danglers. It was the game of games! And yet, it was becoming just a little more boring day after day, despite the crowd of spectators cheering and roaring about each goal scored.

Then one day, almost a day like any other, the least skilled player accidentally got a puck on his stick - and the crowd mocked him "Dangle dangle little star!" But the less skilled player was shy, uncertain, and insecure - and didn’t even want to try to dangle the puck through the hoard of more skilled players. The little player was terrified and threw the puck to another player and yelled “On no! I will pass!"

Their buddy wasn’t good either, and quickly threw the puck to another weakside player, yelling “I will pass, too!" And the less skilled players kept moving the puck like a hot potato from one to another until it reached their last weak side player, who happened to be closest to the opposing net. Last player ran out of weakside buddies to pass to and had to get rid of the puck by throwing it right into the net past a bewildered and disoriented goalie.

And so the term the “pass” was coined, and it became the weapon of choice against skilled ones - for even the slowest pass was much faster than the fastest player.

The game changed that day. It became much more fun. And they all played it happily ever after.
